# bgpatterns

- preserving background texture tiles from eosdev.com,
  an apparently defunct website from Northern California
  collected from archive.org and renamed for consistency.
  e.g. http://web.archive.org/web/20131129023721/
  Free to use for personal and noncommercial websites,
  Attribution asked for.
  
- the textures are given in a range of sizes and colors,
  allowing for differing use cases.

- some of them might be too sweet for many,
  but I'd like to keep the work preserved in entirety.

- initially intended as website backgrounds

- well useable as desktop backgrounds for low-powered computing
  also for color-coding switched desktops

- also try them as terminal background patterns 
  for some alternative focus behind crisp bitmap fonts
  personal favourite: Simplicity, BeatenMetal, Loopy
  some terminals featuring background patterns: stjerm, mate-terminal

- initially I collected them all in a flat directory structure, 
  but my computer just couldn't cope with the sheer number of files
  when generating previews. Maybe just find your faves and then
  copy them to your background patterns directory
